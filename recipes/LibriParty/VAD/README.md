# Voice Activity Detection (VAD) with LibriParty
This folder contains scripts for training a VAD with the [LibriParty dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1--cAS5ePojMwNY5fewioXAv9YlYAWzIJ/view?usp=sharing).
LibriParty contains sequences of 1 minute compose of speech sentences (sampled from LibriSpeech) corrupted by noise and reverberation.

# Training a RNN-based VAD
Run the following command to train the model:
`python train.py hparams/train.yaml`

# Training Time
About 9 minutes for each epoch with a TESLA V100.

# Inference
The pre-trained model + easy inference is available on HuggingFace:
- https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/to_add

Basically, you can run inference with only a few lines of code:

```python
import torchaudio
to add
```
