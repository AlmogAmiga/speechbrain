# ConvTasnet Recipe

* This recipe is able to train several different source separation models on WSJ2 - Mix, including[Sepformer](https: // arxiv.org / abs / 2010.13154), [DPRNN](https: // arxiv.org / abs / 1910.06379), [ConvTasnet](https: // arxiv.org / abs / 1809.07454), [DPTNet](https: // arxiv.org / abs / 2007.13975)

Additional dependency:
```
pip install mir_eval
```

To run it:

```
python experiment.py hyperparams / convtasnet.yaml
```
Make sure you modified the paths inside the parameter file before running the recipe.

# WSJ0-2mix dataset creation
* If not available in the "wsj0mixpath" variable of the parameter file, this recipe creates the standard WSJ0 - 2Mix dataset from scratch.  To generate it you need to own the standard WSJ0 dataset(available though LDC at https: // catalog.ldc.upenn.edu / LDC93S6A).
* The dataset creation script assumes that the original WSJ0 files in the sphere format are already converted to .wav .
* The data creation script for the WSJ - 2Mix dataset uses an Octave, which is called through a python interface(oct2py). Therefore you need to have octave installed.

Depending on your octave version, you might observe the following error:
```
error: called from graphics_toolkit at line 81 column 5
graphics_toolkit: = toolkit is not available
This is in essence a warning and does not affect dataset creation.
```
