# SLU recipes for Fluent Speech Commands
This folder contains recipes for spoken language understanding (SLU) with [Fluent Speech Commands](fluent.ai/research/fluent-speech-commands/).

### Tokenizer recipe
The tokenizer needs to be created before training an SLU model. Run this to train the tokenizer:

```
cd Tokenizer
python train.py hparams/tokenizer_bpe51.yaml
```

### Direct recipe
The "direct" recipe maps the input speech to directly to semantics using a seq2seq model.
The encoder is pre-trained using the LibriSpeech seq2seq recipe.

```
cd direct
python train.py hparams/train.yaml
```
