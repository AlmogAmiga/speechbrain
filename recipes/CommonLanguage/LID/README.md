# Language Identification experiments with CommonLanguage.
This folder contains scripts for running language identificationexperiments with the [CommonLanguage](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Vzgod6NEYO1oZoz_EcgpZkUO9ohQcO1F) dataset. These experiments were highly inspired by Speaker Identification tasks on VoxCeleb and follow a similar path.

# Training [X-Vectors](https://www.danielpovey.com/files/2018_icassp_xvectors.pdf)
Run the following command to train xvectors:

`python train.py hparams/train_xvectors.yaml`

The experiment is fine-tuning of the trained speaker embeddings done for Speaker Identification task on VoxCeleb, which can be found on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/spkrec-xvect-voxceleb). Therefore, most of the architecture choices come from that task.

Data augmentation and environmental corruption are done by concatenating waveforms, dropout, speed change, reverberation, noise, and noise+rev. The batch is double size of the original one. This may lead to
better performance, at the cost of longer training time and higher compute resourses.

# Training [ECAPA-TDNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07143)
Similar to the X-Vector a bigger and more powerful ECAPA-TDNN model can be used.

`python train.py hparams/train_ecapa_tdnn.yaml`

The experiment is also fine-tuning of the trained speaker embeddings done for Speaker Identification task on VoxCeleb, and can be accessed on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/spkrec-ecapa-voxceleb). Therefore, most of the architecture choices come from that task.
