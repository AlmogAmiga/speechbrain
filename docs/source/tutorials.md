# Tutorials

To better understand SpeechBrain, we constantly try to provide new tutorials. At the time of the public release (early 2021), only tutorials covering basics and
advanced usage of SpeechBrain will exist. However, the general plan is to provide
tutorial for each interesting feature (e.g. BeamSearch, Xvectors, GANs, Wav2vec  ...).<br/>

The full list of tutorials can be found either on the corresponding directory of
the official [GitHub](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain) or on the official [website](https://speechbrain.github.io). All the tutorials are developed on the [Google Colab platform](https://colab.research.google.com). This allow users to directly try SpeechBrain on GPUs without the need to setup an environnement. However, we understand that some users might not want to create
a Google account just to test our toolkit. Hence, all the tutorials on the GitHub follows the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) Notebook formalism. Therefore, and once you properly installed Jupyter, any of our tutorial can simply be started locally with:

```
jupyter notebook tutorials/basics/{tutorial}.ipynb
```
