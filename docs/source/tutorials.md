# Tutorials

A good way to familiarize yourself with SpeechBrain is to take a look at the Colab tutorials that we made available. 
More tutorials will be made available as the project will progress. 

The full list of tutorials can be found either on the corresponding directory of
the official [GitHub](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain) or on the official [website](https://speechbrain.github.io). All the tutorials are developed on the [Google Colab platform](https://colab.research.google.com). This allows users to directly try SpeechBrain on GPUs without the need to set up an environment. However, we understand that some users might not want to create
a Google account just to test our toolkit. Hence, all the tutorials follow the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) Notebook formalism. Once Jupyter is properly installed Jupyter,  all tutorials can simply be started locally with:

```
jupyter notebook tutorials/basics/{tutorial}.ipynb
```
